PhyloRelief
===========

PhyloRelief implements an algorithm that introduces the Relief
strategy of feature weighting in a phylogenetic context to identify
those OTUs or groups of OTUs that are correlated for the
differentiation between classes of samples (i.e. healthy vs. disease,
lean vs. obese etc.) in a metagenomic dataset. By integrating the
phylogenetic relationships amongst taxa into the framework of
statistical learning, the method is able to unambiguously group the
taxa into lineages without relying on a precompiled taxonomy, and
accomplishes a ranking of the lineages according to their contribution
to the sample differentiation.
